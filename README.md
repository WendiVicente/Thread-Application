# Thread-Application
University practice third semester
## Description
In this practice, the student must determine the speed and number of steps that a sorting algorithm performs to sort a data set. To do this, a bar graph should be generated to visualize step by step how the algorithm sorts the data set ascending or descending. At the end of this simulation, an HTML report should be generated with the results.
